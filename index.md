## About Me

I am a graduate student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing MS in Robotic Systems Development. I work on autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and ground robots, mainly on the control and motion planning side. I have also worked on LIDAR perception algorithms and deep reinforcement learning for quadcopter navigation.  

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India.
