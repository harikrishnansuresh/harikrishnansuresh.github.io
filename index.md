## About Me

I am a graduate student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing MS in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD). I work on autonomous navigation for quadrotors and ground vehicles, mainly on the control and motion planning side. I am interested in solving these problems using the conventional as well as learning based approaches. I have also worked on LIDAR perception algorithms and deep reinforcement learning for quadrotor navigation. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India. 

## Projects

1. **FlySense - Augmented Reality based assistive technology For safe aerial navigation**
...*MRSD project sponsored by Near Earth Autonomy, Pittsburgh*
...An Augmented Reality based assistive system that provides complete and enhanced situational awareness through real time visual and audio feedback and enables pilots to navigate safely. FlySense offers a high level of assistance through mapping of surrounding obstacles and low-level autonomy to override bad decisions by the pilot. 

2. **Trajectory tracking control of a quadcopter using cascaded linear and nonlinear techniques**

3. **Learning control policies for quadcopter navigation with battery constraints**

4. **Field scale autonomy for vineyards**

5. **Autonomous navigation stack for a KUKA youBot for a controlled indoor environment**

6. **Data processing for real world user drive cycle generation and fuel economy simulations**
